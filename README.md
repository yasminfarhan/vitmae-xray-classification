# Fine-tuning Transformers with Ray-Tune & Visualization

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of transformer-based models, specifically Hugging Face's pretrained ViTMAE for the purposes of X-Ray image classification. Subsequently, it involves evaluating the model's performance on the dataset retrieved from the Hugging Face dataset hub [https://huggingface.co/datasets/keremberke/chest-xray-classification] and visualizing the results.

## Requirements
Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install ray[tune] scikit-plot==0.3.7 transformers
```

## How It Works
### Hyperparameter Tuning using Ray-Tune
Initialize the Ray-Tune and the necessary transformers.
Specify the task, the dataset, and the model configuration.
Define the model initialization function:
Load a pretrained model.
Freeze the entire model, then re-enable classifier weights.
Set training arguments.
Define a tuning configuration with hyperparameter search space.
Use the PopulationBasedTraining (PBT) scheduler for Ray-Tune with hyperparameter mutations.
Initialize the CLIReporter for logging.
Launch hyperparameter search using Ray-Tune.
### Fine-tuning on Custom Dataset
Load a fine-tuning dataset.
Load a pre-trained model with the custom dataset labels.
Define training arguments for fine-tuning.
Define a custom metrics function.
Create a trainer and perform training.
Save the model and its metrics.
### Inference & Visualization
Perform inference on test data.
Evaluate the model's performance with various metrics.
Visualize the class distribution, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, cumulative gains chart, and calibration curve using scikit-plot.
## Usage
Ensure you have the necessary packages installed.
Download and prepare your dataset.
Update the script's configurations according to your requirements.
Run the script.
Key Components
Ray-Tune with PBT: Efficient hyperparameter tuning for large-scale training. PBT improves convergence by propagating good hyperparameters across the population.
Transformers Library: Used for loading and fine-tuning transformer models.
Visualization: Evaluate and visualize the model's performance using various metrics and plots.
## Note
Some variables, like data_dir_name, labels, model_name_or_path, ds, collate_fn, and image_processor, seem to be externally defined or imported. Ensure you initialize or import these components correctly before running the script.

## Conclusion
This project provides an end-to-end demonstration of fine-tuning transformers with efficient hyperparameter search, followed by detailed evaluation and visualization of the model's performance.
